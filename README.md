# jupiter-task

#### This task was given as a coding round for Internship at Jupiter.

Feel free to add your own objects just by following the menu

Requirements Implemented from the pdf file:
- A restaurant can register itself with the system and a user can create, update, delete, get his/her profile.
- Users can search for the restaurant using the restaurant name.
- Restaurants can add or update food-menu.
- Users can see the food-menu and place an order to get the food items based on cuisine type.
- A restaurant has fixed capacity of processing "n"  orders at a time. It cannot accept more than "n" orders at a time. Values of "n" varies for different restaurants. The value of "n" can be given either at the time of registeration or after login at any time.

External Requirements added:
- Users can get the order status anytime. Order Recieved, Order Accepted, Order being Prepared, Order Out for Delivery, Order Delivered.

NOTE: I didn't have enough time to either implement a GUI or to add a pipelined input, will do that in the next version
